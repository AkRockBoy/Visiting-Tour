<h4 class="bg-secondary text-dark"><p align="center"><B>Ram Mandir</B>&nbsp is a Hindu temple that is being built in Ayodhya, 
Uttar Pradesh, India, at the site of Ram Janmabhoomi,
according to the Ramayana, the birthplace of Rama, a principal deity of Hinduism.
</p>
<p align="center">Ram Janmabhoomi (literally, "Rama's birthplace") is the site that is hypothesized to be the birthplace 
of Rama, believed to be the seventh avatar of the Hindu deity Vishnu. The Ramayana states that
the location of Rama's birthplace is on the banks of the Sarayu river in a city called "Ayodhya".</p>
<br>
<p align="center">
 Some Hindus claim that the exact site of Rama's birthplace is where the Babri Masjid once stood in the present-day Ayodhya, 
Uttar Pradesh.
[2] According to this theory, the Mughals demolished a 
Hindu shrine that marked the spot, and constructed a mosque in its place. People opposed to this theory state that such claims arose only 
in the 18th century, and that there is no evidence for the spot being the birthplace of Rama. Several other sites, including places in other 
parts of India, Afghanistan, and Nepal, have been proposed as birthplaces of Rama. The political, historical and socio-religious 
debate over the history and location of the Babri Mosque, and whether a 
previous temple was demolished or modified to create it, is known as the Ayodhya dispute.
In 1992, the demolition of the Babri Masjid by Hindu nationalists triggered widespread 
Hindu-Muslim violence. The legal dispute over the property reached the Indian Supreme Court, which heard the title dispute cases from August to October 2019.[3][4] On 9 November 2019, the
 Supreme Court ordered the land to be handed over to a trust to build a Hindu temple.[5]
